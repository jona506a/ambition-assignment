In english, just in case.

It is written in Vanilla JavaScript in Frontend and Node.js in Backend.

Host the index.html file on your preferred hosting platform (I used Live Server on VScode).
For node, I have node installed on my computer, and write npm install inside the server folder.
Launch the server with node server.js in the respective folder.

Unfortunately I ran out of time, since I wrote it in Vanilla JS, forgetting that it is 3 years since I actually made a project in this. I would have preferred react,
but based on the base html file I was given, I got the impression that I should keep that structure. This is a fault on my part. The API looked fun and I 
wish that I had gotten to work more with it.

Thank you
